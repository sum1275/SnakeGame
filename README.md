## Opening `index.html` using a live server:

If you prefer using a live server for development, follow these steps:

 **Install a live server extension** in your code editor if you haven't already. Some popular choices include:
   - [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) for Visual Studio Code.
   - [LiveReload](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/LiveReload) for Sublime Text.
   - [Web Server for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb) extension for Chrome.

 **Open `index.html`** in your code editor.

 **Start the live server:**
   - Launch the live server extension.
   - The Snake game will automatically open in your default web browser with live reloading enabled.

This method allows you to see real-time updates as you modify the game code.
